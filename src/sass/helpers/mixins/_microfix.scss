 *
 * 1. The space content is one way to avoid an Opera bug when the
 *  contenteditable attribute is included anywhere else in the document.
 *  Otherwise it causes space to appear at the top and bottom of elements
 *  that are clearfixed.
 * 2. The use of `table` rather than `block` is only necessary if using
 *  `:before` to contain the top-margins of child elements.
